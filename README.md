# Gates
I love things which are structurally organized and free to compose. Such things provide people with possibilities of rational design and achieve effortless elegance, such as Markdown, logic gates, and Swift Playground Books. As a matter of fact, programming itself is such a thing. I think thatâ€™s why it fascinates and motivates me all through the years.



**Note:**

Although the compatibility is taken into consideration, it is highly recommended that the playground book to be experienced on an iPad Pro 10.5-inch (for it is the exact size I use for developing and testing) in landscape orientation.
