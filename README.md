I love things which are structurally organized and free to compose. Such things provide people with possibilities of rational design and achieve effortless elegance, such as Markdown, logic gates, and Swift Playground Books. As a matter of fact, programming itself is such a thing. I think thatâ€™s why it fascinates and motivates me all through the years.
