 - Note:
 You may have noticed that some gates are "replaceable", which means their functions can be **fully** replaced by some other gates.
 \
 \
 As a matter of fact, *Charles Sanders Peirce* (during 1880â€“81) showed that [NOR gates](glossary://NOR%20gate) alone (or alternatively [NAND gates](glossary://NAND%20gate) alone) can be used to reproduce the functions of all the other logic gates. The first published proof was by *Henry M. Sheffer* in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called Sheffer stroke; the logical NOR is sometimes called Peirce's arrow. Consequently, these gates are sometimes called [universal logic gates](glossary://universal%20logic%20gate).
 \
 \
 On the next two pages, you'll try to prove this theorem partly.
 
 
Now, let's build a [OR gate](glossary://OR%20gate) using [NAND gates](glossary://NAND%20gate) **only**.\
As is shown on the right, the circuit is already built. Your task is to decide the inputs in order to make the circuit function juse as a [OR gate](glossary://OR%20gate).\
Related [truth tables](glossary://truth%20table) are posted as references.
