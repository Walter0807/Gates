Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values `true` and `false`, usually denoted `1` and `0` respectively. It was introduced by *George Boole* in his first book *The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)*, and has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics.

 

 Boolean operations can be used to describe connections between multiple Boolean variables. The basic operations of Boolean algebra are `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

 

 A logic gate is a physical device which implements a Boolean operation; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. 



The basic logic gates are:

- AND gate: A `true` output results only if all the inputs to the gate are `true`.
- OR gate: A `true` output results if one or both the inputs to the gate are `true`.
- NOT gate: If the applied input is `false` then the output becomes `high` and vice versa.

The bahavior of these gates are represented by the truth tables on the right.

 Let's start by trying to set the input values of the logic gates.

 





Now let's use **Boolean operations** to model some variables in real life. Additionally, they can be represented by cascading logic gates.

 - Example: A playful Boy

 My younger brother is obsessed with basketballüèÄ and doesn't feel comfortable doing his homeworküìö. There's no difficulty to infer his mood:

 The boy is happyüòÅ **only** when:

- He plays basketball.
- He does't have to do his homework.



Despite the 3 basic logic gates, another 4 gates are also widely used:

- NAND gate: The output is `false` **only** if both its inputs are `true`.
- NOR gate: The output is `true` **only** if both its inputs are `false`.
- XNOR gate: The output is `true` **only** if both its inputs are the same.
- XOR gate: The output is `true` **only** if both its inputs are different.
